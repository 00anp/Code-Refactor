# Code-Refactor
Description
This project contains a corrected version of HTML and CSS files, both rendered to be the same webpage as before.
The objective was to have HTML code with SEO attributes. I corrected the generic tags to SEO friendly tags.
Also, there were individual CSS classes for each HTML element, this was causing repetion in the code, so I grouped the classes that had similar attributes to have less repeated code.
